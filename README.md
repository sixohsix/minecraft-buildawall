buildawall - a wall builder for Minecraft. It builds a wall around
your world.


Minecraft worlds are driven by a seed, and Minecraft creates the world
from the seed as you visit new parts. However, upgrades to Minecraft
can knock the world builder out of whack, and create jarring
discontinuities where the old world ends and the new world begins.

Buildawall puts a wall around your existing world, creating a
psychological and in-game division between old and new.

By default the wall is white wool with a core of indestructable
bedrock. It's not-quite maximum height or depth, so you can climb over
it or burrow under it, though that's still a challenge. By tweaking
the script you can change the wall material, and make it destructable
if you want.
